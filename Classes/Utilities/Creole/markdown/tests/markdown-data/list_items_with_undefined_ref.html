<ul>
<li><p>[[\yii\caching\ApcCache]]: uses PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php">APC</a> extension. This option can be
considered as the fastest one when dealing with cache for a centralized thick application (e.g. one
server, no dedicated load balancers, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li><p>[[\yii\caching\DbCache]]: uses a database table to store cached data. By default, it will create and use a
<a href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite3</a> database under the runtime directory. You can explicitly specify a database for
it to use by setting its <code>db</code> property.</p>
